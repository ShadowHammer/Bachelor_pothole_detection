# Bachelor_pothole_detection

This repository contains the Neural Network using Faster R-CNN called Faster R-CNN.ipynb.

It also contains the 2 folders Pothole_large_coco and Pothole_coco.

Pothole_Large_coco contains the large dataset: https://universe.roboflow.com/imacs-pothole-detection-wo8mu/pothole-detection-irkz9

Pothole_coco contains the small dataset: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/pothole/1

It also contains the README.txt file that explains how to run the code.

The 2 YOLO models that this code is compared to are from these 2 GitHub repositories:

YOLOv7: https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7
